Delicious is a web application that the user can use to find, discover, and explore recipes of all kinds. On every page of the site, the user can search for specific recipes in the top search bar or quickly view recipes using the cuisine buttons located directly under the 'Random Trivia' section. On the homepage the user is greeted by several recipe carousels, including ‘Popular Picks’, ‘Our Vegetarian Picks’, 'Our Paleo Picks' and ‘Our Ketogenic Picks’, and clicking on these recipe cards will link to the corresponding recipe page. At the bottom of the homepage the user also has the ability to find recipes based on what ingredients they have available to them. On the recipe page the user can click either ‘instructions’ or ‘ingredients’ to view the relevant information related to the recipe. There is also a carousel of ‘Similar Recipes’ conveniently located at the bottom of the page.
